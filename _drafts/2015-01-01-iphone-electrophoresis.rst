I've wanted a gel electrophoresis chamber for a while. I've held back because 
they cost like $300 and I don't want to spend that much on a tool that won't
get used all that often. So, with a bit of my new years eve 2014, I decided 
I would make my own.

I had all the supplies I needed.

    - 1 iPhone 5C case.
    - 1 piece of curmpled tin foil
    - 1 black berry.
    - 1 bottle of malbec
    - 3 hours of free time.

I used my girlfriend's iPhone 5C case as the chamber. I used the top of the case
to build a comb. (Note: cutting Apple plastic is quite difficult. Yet another 
props to Apple on their packaging. Not only is their packaging elegant and 
precise, it is structruarly integrous). I used agar I had around for making 
petri dishes. (Possible problem #1). I used baking soda and distilled H2O 
for my buffer. I used some aligator clips and an 120 AC to 12 DC converter.

I dropped the tin foil into the well and let the agar sit on top.

Once I pulled out the comb, I put let the shit sit for an hour while I went to 
dinner. Yatenga, right around the corner from my appartment. Steak was okay
by the stir fried veggies were absolutley wonderful. 

When I got back I filled the wells with, 1 2 3 4, then I pour on the buffer
from the side of the chamber farthest from the wells. (Possible problem #2, I
didn't let the buffer go into the well first. Mabys cut down on conduction)
I took meausurement of the resistance of the system before and fater the buffer.

Got some wild numbers once the buffer was in. Then I hooked up the electrodes 
and let that shit sit. Started to watch the movie Meloncolia, gorgeous visuals.
Friend didn't want to watch that after a while so we bailed on Meloncolia
and started Frequencies (Netflix baby). (I am not paid by anyone.) My thoughts: 
If a machine can discover that it can control itself, does that make it any less
a machine? If a machine discovers that it can control itself, does its choice 
(whether to do so and control itself or not to) make it any less a machine?
What is a decision and is it the defining charactersitic of consiousness. Maybe.

After the movie, it looks like there was very little movement. I also took a 
voltage reading at 2hr 35 min into the run. ~12VDC. I will leave it over night.
