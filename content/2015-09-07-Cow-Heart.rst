Motivation
==========

Did you know you can buy hearts at the grocerry store? I didn't. I walked into
associated on 133rd and Lenox and saw a beef heart sitting amounts the other
meats. My initial reaction was "What? Heart?". My secondary reaction was 
"Yeah, I'm buying this".

**WARNING**: I'm going to show pictures of beef heart.

I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, other than look at the muscle
tissue and hopefully some chambers. However after a few milliseconds, 
I decided to dissect it, old school style.

My friend Derek got in on the fun and we found some lab like instructions on
the web for dissecting a cow heart. With a cookie sheet and some box knifes, 
we got started.

When we first started looking at the heart, we noticed what we thought 
were chordae tendineae. Since we didn't have a high school anatomy teacher
with us to confirm our findings, we had to go on gut.

What I also found interesting was how deep the chambers seemed to go.
The chamber size really gave you a since for the size of the animal.
On the other hand though, oddly enough, some of the blood vessels 
seemed extraordinarily small; blood vessels that seemed to match up
(location-wise) with major arteries of the heart from our lab handout.

After chatting a bit, Derek and I came to the conclusion that part of 
the heart was missing. We think that, at the place were they cut out the
cow hearts, they cut off the not-so-muscular parts of the heart because
that doesn't get eaten. So what we were left with was most of the left
ventricle, a bit of the right ventricle, and hardly no atria.
