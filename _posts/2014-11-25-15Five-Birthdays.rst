I work at `15Five <http://www.15Five.com>`_. One of the things 15Five strives 
for is an environment in which its team members can grow. 15Five puts money
where is mouth is and gives each employee a birthday bonus; cash to fund 
growth as an individual. We can spend the birthday bonus however we like (gym,
skydiving, meditation excursion, microscopes) with one stipulation: we have to 
report back to the team and share how we grew. 

I have wanted a compound microscope for some time and could never justify the
cost. And I never thought 'gotta do it for work' was going to be how I justified 
such a purchase. 

With my birthday bonus I purchased a 
`AmScope T490B <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QEFO1Q>`_ 
from amazon along with all
the necessary addons (sans my camera) to take photos of specimens under
observation.

The microscope is fantastic and with my camera attached I can take and share 
some really sweet photos.
