Introduction
------------

I've released a number of Python packages over the past few months and I've
been curious about how I should version them. I decided to write a new 
package plottags_ that I could use to plot the tag history for a repository 
with respect to time. Here are a few of the plots I've created with 
plottags_.

.. _plottags: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plottags

Discussion
----------

I think the most interesting graph is Ansible's. The Ansible project
has an incredibly steady tagging practice. I immediately assume that 
this stability is due to the fact that Ansible has a number of incentives to 
release steadily. Ansible is, after all, a product people pay for. After
seeing Nginx's graph, I'm pretty confident that we'd see some similarly 
steady trends in other psuedo-commercial packages.
