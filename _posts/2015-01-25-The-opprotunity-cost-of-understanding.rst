title: The Oprotunity cost of understanding.
---

What happens when you understand something? It sets in certain paths of 
neurons in your brain and makes it easier to understand it next time. Does that
mean that something else is now harder to grasp? Because you now have understood
long division done one way, does that make it harder to understand long division
via another method? Or worse does it mean that its harder to understand something
like love? I'm really not sure, but let's dive in. 

For this article, I'm just going focus on asking questions around the costs
of understaning related topics.

What if my understanding of A came about at age of 22. Does that make it harder
to understand B if B is closely related to A. If so, how much harder? Is there
a topic that once understood, blocks like an antibody agasint infection,
the undersntaidng of another topic. How would we know? What would that look like
from the outside (ie. someone not experiencing this).

I imagine it would look like two groups that are every increasing in size, 
never agreeing and always perplexed (or angry) that the other group doesn't 
understand. The first though I have is religion. Of course if we believe that
conversion is something that is possible and authentic after someone has claimed
to be a true believer of their original religion, then we have to believe 
that religion doesn't fall under the category of topics that once understood in 
one way prohibts an understander from understanding in anohter way. Given that
we do not, see anything close to the example of complete dicotomy, we can assume
that the extream cirucmstance of understanding once and loosing for every the 
ability to understand another topic is extreamly small if not impossible. 

What are we then left with? We are left with how much? How much does it cost us
to understand this topic this way? How much is understanidng this topic this 
way going to prohibit us from diving deeper into a better understanding of 
another topic. I relate this back to thermodynamics and the idea of local and
abosultute maxima. You can reach a local minuma by rolling around; eventually
you'll hit a local minima. But have you hit an aboslute minima? Only way to
know is to expend energy getting out of the well you are in and checking 
for all wells. Not only is getting out of the first well a challenge that incurs
a cost, but doing this for all wells is a mutliple of that challenge. There
could be infinite numbers of ways to understand anything but I assue after
a few tries, one will settle for the lowest found in history.



understanding onset 
- young = Taken for granted? Harder to see that there is somehting else to be understood?
- middle age = 
- old = I don'nt know. Out of respect, I'm not going to make any assumptions
